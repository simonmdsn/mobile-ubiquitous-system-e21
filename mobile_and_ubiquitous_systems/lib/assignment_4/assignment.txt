Develop an architectural prototype for the application of a performance tactic.

STEP 1 Select a tactic, e.g, you could find a performance
tactic that consider the QAS you already wrote earlier this lecture


STEP 2 Code the prototype, e.g. create some dummy data,
implement some handling of the data following the tactic and create an output.

STEP 3 Study the result to evaluate if the prototype indicate that the tactic can help satisfy
the QAS (e.g. benchmark compared to a trivial implementation before applying the tactic).

Hand-in your results (e.g. graph or numbers) including type of AP developed and conclusions
 (e.g. does the tactic enable you to satisfy the QAS?, how large is the improvement when applying the tactic?
